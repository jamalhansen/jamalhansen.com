SQL is the language of data — and if you work in Python, learning it will make you better at nearly everything you already do. This series walks you through SQL from first principles using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), a modern, local database that runs inside Python with no server setup required. No credentials, no Docker, no configuration. Just Python and data.

Each post builds on the last. By the end you'll be writing queries, filtering and aggregating data, joining related tables, and using advanced features like CTEs and subqueries — all explained from a Python developer's perspective.
