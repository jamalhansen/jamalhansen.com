## Hi, I'm Jamal Hansen

I'm a data engineer with a passion for exploring the intersection of AI, cloud technologies, and the future of work. I believe in building purposeful systems that solve real problems and create meaningful impact.

### What I Do

As a data engineer, I work with cloud platforms, data pipelines, and modern architecture patterns. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Cloud Engineering**: Working extensively with AWS services and cloud-native solutions
- **Data Architecture**: Building scalable data pipelines and systems
- **AI Integration**: Exploring how artificial intelligence can enhance data workflows
- **Agentic AI**: Investigating autonomous AI systems and their practical applications

### My Learning Journey

I'm committed to continuous learning and sharing what I discover along the way. You'll find me writing about:

- **AWS Certifications**: My journey through cloud certification exams and practical cloud engineering
- **Agentic AI**: Experiments with autonomous AI systems and their real-world applications  
- **Goal Setting**: Systematic approaches to personal and professional development
- **Technology Insights**: Practical lessons from working with modern data and cloud technologies

### Beyond Technology

When I'm not building data systems or exploring AI, I'm focused on intentional living and goal-oriented growth. I believe in:

- Setting purposeful yearly goals and tracking progress systematically
- Using technology to augment human capability, not replace it
- Building systems that are both technically sound and ethically responsible
- Sharing knowledge to help others on similar journeys

### Connect With Me

I'm always interested in connecting with others who are passionate about data, AI, and building meaningful systems. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamalhansen) or explore my thoughts through the posts on this site.

Whether you're here to learn about AWS certifications, dive into agentic AI concepts, or explore systematic approaches to goal setting, I hope you find something valuable to take away.
