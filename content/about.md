I'm a data scientist focused on building production AI applications and helping developers get more out of their data. I write to work through ideas, document what I build, and share what I learn along the way. Most posts start as something I explained to a colleague or junior developer — then get cleaned up into something worth publishing.

A lot of the content here follows two threads. The first is **SQL for Python developers**: a series I started because so many Python devs avoid or underuse SQL. Understanding how SQL thinks changed how I write Python, and I wanted to make that shift accessible to others. The second thread is **LLM development** — practical posts from building agents, working with local models, and figuring out where AI actually fits in production workflows. I also write about certifications, tools, and the general experience of learning in public.

I'm a husband and dad, which has a way of focusing you on what actually matters. I read mystery, sci-fi, and fantasy when I can stay awake long enough. I'm slowly learning Japanese and enjoy board games when life allows.
