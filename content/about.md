## Hi, I'm Jamal Hansen

I'm a data engineer who spends way too much time thinking about AI, cloud infrastructure, and how work is changing. I like building things that actually solve problems instead of just being technically interesting.

### What I Do

I work with cloud platforms, data pipelines, and whatever architecture pattern makes sense for the problem. Right now I'm really into:

- **Cloud Engineering**: Mostly AWS. I've gotten pretty deep into their services.
- **Data Architecture**: Building pipelines that don't fall over when things get messy
- **AI Integration**: Figuring out where AI actually helps vs. where it's just hype
- **Agentic AI**: Playing with autonomous AI systems to see what they can actually do

### What I Write About

I learn by doing, and I write about what I'm learning. Expect posts on:

- **AWS Certifications**: What I've learned studying for and taking AWS exams
- **Agentic AI**: Real experiments with AI agents, not just theory
- **Goal Setting**: How I set and track goals (I'm probably too systematic about this)
- **Python and SQL**: Practical tips for working with data

### The Rest

When I'm not coding or reading AWS documentation, I'm probably setting quarterly goals or experimenting with some new AI tool. I tend to be pretty methodical about personal development—it's just how I'm wired.

I think technology should make humans more capable, not replace them. And I think if you're building systems that affect people's lives, you have a responsibility to build them thoughtfully.

### Let's Connect

If you're into data, AI, or building things that matter, I'd love to hear from you. Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamalhansen) or just read through the posts here.

*This site runs on Hugo with the Qubt theme, hosted on AWS. I should probably write a post about the setup.*
