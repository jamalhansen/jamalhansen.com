## Hi, I'm Jamal Hansen

I'm a data scientist building solutions and teaching the next generation of developers how to work with AI. I write about what I'm learning, from SQL fundamentals to agentic AI, because teaching helps me understand concepts more deeply.

### What I Do

I'm currently wrapping up an MBA while preparing for my second round of paternity leave, which has taught me a lot about balancing ambitious technical work with the things that actually matter.

My technical focus includes:

- AI & Machine Learning: Building production LLM applications and teaching teams how to work effectively with AI
- Data Science: Python, SQL, and the full analytics stack
- Technical Leadership: Mentoring junior developers and translating complex AI concepts for non-technical stakeholders

### What I Write About

I maintain an active blog and newsletter covering:

- SQL for Python Developers: A series breaking down database concepts for programmers coming from Python
- LLM Applications: Practical experiences building with large language models in production
- Learning in Public: My journey through AI engineering courses, certifications, and technical reading

I believe in learning by teaching. My blog posts often start as internal documentation or explanations I've given to my team, then evolve into more polished articles.

### Beyond Code

I'm a husband and father navigating the chaos of life with a newborn while trying to maintain my learning momentum. I read mystery, sci-fi, and fantasy novels when I can stay awake long enough. I'm also slowly learning Japanese and enjoy board games when there's time.

I track my goals systematically (maybe too systematically) and believe in continuous improvement through deliberate practice.
