Today I joined the [AWS Card Clash: Gen AI Battles | S1 E1 | Model Access Showdown](https://www.linkedin.com/events/awscardclash-genaibattles-s1e1-7319012363007897600/theater/) on LinkedIn. This session demoed the AWS Card Clash learning game available on AWS SkillBuilder. The session was hosted by [Curtis Morton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/curtisdmorton/), [Jason Cuddy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasoncuddy/), and [Brittany Wolfrom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittany-wolfrom/).

AWS Card Clash is a fun and engaging card game that pits two players against each other to complete architecture diagrams.

Some of the things that I liked about this as a learning activity are:

- The diagrams are actual architectures that you might use in AWS
- The actual symbols for the different services are used to help identify them
- There are multiple ways to access additional information about each service to better understand it
- The security feature used to protect your plays are actual AWS security services.

Some of the things that I liked about this as a game are:

- The are single and multiplayer versions of the game
- It uses cards, energy management, and other game elements in the game flow
- It can be played by players who are beginning their AWS learning journey
- There is a potential to use strategy rather than just AWS knowledge to win

Overall this was a great session and I have already run through a trial game on my own to better understand how it works. I expect to be playing more of this and hope to be able to play the multiplayer mode soon.
