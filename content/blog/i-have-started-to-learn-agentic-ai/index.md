I've been wanting to learn more about artificial intelligence and in particular agentic AI. This past week I started a training on udemy called [The complete Agentic AI Engineering Course](https://udemy.com/course/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course/learn/lecture/49771155#overview) by [Ed Donner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddonner/) and Ligency Team.

The class is that it doesn't tout itself as a "Learn everything about agentic AI in 30 Days" or "4 hours to AI Engineer". Those types of titles typically indicate that the training is either very high level or filled with fluff (sometimes both). 

Instead the class is broken down into 6 weeks of trainings with five days of videos per week. I find this to be nice because the learning is already segmented into useful groupings so that I don't have to think about what the appropriate amount to consume is, it's already in serving sizes

Another great thing about the class is that it jumps right in to hands on tutorials with beautifully formatted jupyter notebooks that I can see in use on the videos and then explore on my own. 

I have now completed the third day and I have learned about what it means to be an agentic AI. I have also:

- Learned about agentic patterns
- Used multiple LLMs including:
  - Open AI
  - Gemini
  - Deepseek
  - Groq
  - Anthropic
  - Ollama
- Used AI to guide the workflow using multiple AIs

So far this class has been great and the lectures are engaging. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's session.
